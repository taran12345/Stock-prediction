RED ZONE
Security has become an essential aspect of everyday life in India. One of the way in which we can provide the security is by enabling people with vital inforamtion on the security aspects for the route they would take during the travel from one place to another. In this problem, we are envisioning an applicatiopn that will suspect any possible security lapse in a location enroute to a destination. A user would use a map which will display all possible areas of red-alert for security from the source to destination. So we can use route map(like google maps) which could highlight as red/yellow/green indicating high , medium and low risks zones.The profiling of data coulod be done based on history of crimes in the area, presence of people, security guards, presence of surveillance cameras, no of vehicle in the area at tha given time.

Data Collection
In this model we are using a dummy data scrapped from various third party websites. Later data can be collected through public campaign, public reviews.

Model Training:
Model will be trained using these data collected from various sources using deep neural network. Parameters considered while training the model:

history of crimes in the area
presence of people
security guards
presence of surveillance cameras
Model Prediction:
Model will predict whether the route on which user is planning to travel is safe or not. For this we will take source and destination as an input from the user.

Model Upgradtion:
Various cities which are flagged as red, yellow, green are regularly updated on the basis of new data(i.e. increase/decrease in criminal activities)
